# titanic
This is my first Kaggle project. I chose this project because it is well-guided and renowned, making it the perfect starting point for beginners. For those who are not familiar with the Kaggle platform, I highly recommend this project to get acquainted with machine learning and the Kaggle website.

The challenge
The competition is simple: we want you to use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.

The data
To take a look at the competition data, click on the Data tab at the top of the competition page. Then, scroll down to find the list of files.
There are three files in the data: (1) train.csv, (2) test.csv, and (3) gender_submission.csv.

(1) train.csv
train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers, to be exact -- where each passenger gets a different row in the table). To investigate this data, click on the name of the file on the left of the screen. Once you've done this, you can view all of the data in the window.



The values in the second column ("Survived") can be used to determine whether each passenger survived or not:

if it's a "1", the passenger survived.
if it's a "0", the passenger died.
